= Implementing model rules in a plugin

A plugin can define rules by extending link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/model/RuleSource.html[RuleSource] and adding methods that define the rules. The plugin class can either extend link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/model/RuleSource.html[RuleSource] directly or can implement link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/api/Plugin.html[Plugin] and include a nested link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/model/RuleSource.html[RuleSource] subclass.

Refer to the API docs for link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/model/RuleSource.html[RuleSource] for more details.

== Applying additional rules

A rule method annotated with link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/model/Rules.html[Rules] can apply a link:{javadoc-path}/org/gradle/model/RuleSource.html[RuleSource] to a target model element.
